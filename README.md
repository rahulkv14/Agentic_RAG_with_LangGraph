This project focuses on building an intelligent question-answering
system that retrieves information from both internal knowledge
sources and real-time web search. Multiple language models are used to generate and compare
answers, ensuring reliability through evaluation against verified
reference data. The system also provides transparent evaluation results to help
users understand how the final response is selected.
